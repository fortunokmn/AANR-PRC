It is the healthiest form of a nourishing snack, especially when roasted on flames or boiled; it has a different taste each time. The setting on the actual cob is pearl like, like someone took the time to wrap a garland of pearls around it. It is often said that you first eat with your eyes. What this really means is that much of the snack you much on every day is because you may see somebody else doing the same or glance at various restaurants and fast food joints when you&amp;rsquo;re on your way to work or home. Corns are a treat to look at and cooking it on open fires, family barbeques or boiling is also a fantastic experience.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&amp;nbsp;https:\/\/www.naturalfoodseries.com\/13-benefits-corn-maize\/&lt;\/p&gt;","link":"1527060981-5faa70cc679f832dbb985b729eb1f3649fe255ec-corn.jpg"},{"data_source":"Images","title":"Rice","author":"irri2018","date":"2018-05-23 15:38:30","description":"&lt;p&gt;White rice comes in short-grain and long-grain varieties. Short-grain rice is very starchy and becomes soft and sticky when you cook it, which makes it ideal for sushi. Short-grain rice is also used in paella and risotto dishes, and sometimes mixed into chili and stews. Long-grain rice, such as jasmine and basmati, contains less starch, so the cooked grains are drier and don&amp;rsquo;t clump together. White rice is about 90 percent carbohydrate, 8 percent protein and 2 percent fat, according to the book &amp;ldquo;Contemporary Nutrition: Functional Approach.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; White rice is a good source of magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, selenium, iron, folic acid, thiamine and niacin. It is low in fiber and its fat content is primarily omega-6 fatty acids, which are considered pro-inflammatory.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&amp;nbsp;https:\/\/www.healthyoptions.com.ph\/newsdigest\/health-manual-for-all-ages\/what-nutrition-does-rice-provide&lt;\/p&gt;","link":"1527061110-5faa70cc679f832dbb985b729eb1f3649fe255ec-rice.jpg"},{"data_source":"Images","title":"Coffee","author":"irri2018","date":"2018-05-23 15:41:35","description":"&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and R&amp;eacute;union in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&amp;nbsp;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coffee&lt;\/p&gt;","link":"1527061295-5faa70cc679f832dbb985b729eb1f3649fe255ec-coffee.jpg"},{"data_source":"Images","title":"Cacao","author":"irri2018","date":"2018-05-23 15:46:18","description":"&lt;p&gt;Cacao (Theobroma cacao) belongs to the genus Theobroma classified under the subfamily Sterculioideae of the mallow family Malvaceae.

Cupua&amp;ccedil;u, Theobroma grandiflorum, is a closely related species found in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Like cacao, it is also the source for a kind of chocolate known as cupulate or cupua&amp;ccedil;u chocolate.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species &amp;ndash; Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa &amp;times; paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata &amp;times; M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&amp;nbsp;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Banana&lt;\/p&gt;","link":"1527061749-5faa70cc679f832dbb985b729eb1f3649fe255ec-banana.jpg"}]
